Maintain a documentation dir at ./docs

Keep this updated with docs for the backend and frontend as well as a readme file in the ./docs directory.

# frontend

Only use svelte 5 code for the frontend components.
Use primarily tailwind for all css unless a custom item is needs where tailwind is not sufficiant.
Prefer creating components rather than endlessly adding to one page.

# backend

Only use JavaScript (Node.js) for the backend components.
Use primarily Express.js for all server-side logic unless a custom solution is needed where Express is not sufficient.

# running the development server

Do not ask me to run it because it is most likely running already.

# ui

Keep all pages consistent in design and behavior.
